<h1>Gemini</h1> <p>Gemini (♊︎) (/ˈdʒɛmɪnaɪ/ JEM-in-eye, Latin for "twins") is the third astrological sign in the 
    zodiac. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this sign between about May 21 to June 21. Gemini is
     represented by the twins, Castor and Pollux, known as the Dioscuri in Greek mythology. It is a positive, mutable
      sign.Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who 
builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their
 approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.</p>
