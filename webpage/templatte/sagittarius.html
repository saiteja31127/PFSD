<h1>Sagittarius</h1> 
<p>Sagittarians are optimistic, lovers of freedom, hilarious, fair-minded, honest and intellectual. They are 
    spontaneous and fun, usually with a lot of friends, and are perhaps the best conversationalists in the zodiac 
    (maybe tied with Gemini).
Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who 
builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their
 approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.</p>
 <p>In astrology, Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about November 22 to about December 21. It is represented either by a centaur shooting a bow and arrow or by an arrow drawn across a bow.</p>
