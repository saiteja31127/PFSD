<h1> Leo</h1>
<p>Leo (♌︎) (Greek: Λέων, Leōn), Latin for Lion, is the fifth sign of the zodiac. It corresponds to the constellation 
    Leo and comes after Cancer and before Virgo. The traditional Western zodiac associates Leo with the period 
    between about July 23 and August 22, and the sign spans the 120th to 150th degree of celestial longitude.

    Leo is associated with fire, accompanied by Aries and Sagittarius, and its modality is fixed. The constellation Leo is associated with the mythological Nemean lion.[3] The lion is a very important and prominent symbol in Greek mythology
Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who 
builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their
 approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.
