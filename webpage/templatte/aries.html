<h1>Aries</h1> 
<p>Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who 
builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their
 approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.</p>
 <p>Aries(♈︎) (Greek: Κριός [Kriós], Latin for "ram") is the first astrological sign in the zodiac, spanning the
     first 30 degrees of celestial longitude (0°≤ λ <30°)Aries is the first fire sign in the zodiac, the other fire signs being Leo and Sagittarius. Individuals born between these dates, depending on which system of astrology they subscribe to, may be called Ariens.[2] The color for Aries is red. [4] In astrology, Aries is the cardinal sign of the fire trigon. It is one of the six positive signs.

     The equivalent in the Hindu solar calendar is Meṣa</p>
