<h1>Pisces</h1> 
<p>
    Compassionate, artistic, deeply emotional, especially empathic, at least a little bit psychic, and often inclined to throw themselves into caring for others at all costs, the Pisces in your life are some of the most magical people you'll ever come in contact with.</p>
 <p>Pisces (♓︎) (/ˈpaɪsiːz/; Ancient Greek: Ἰχθύες Ikhthyes) is the twelfth and final astrological sign in the zodiac.
     It is a negative, mutable sign. It spans 330° to 360° of celestial longitude. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun
     transits this area between February 19 and March 20. In classical interpretations, the symbol of the fish is
      derived from the ichthyocentaurs, who aided Aphrodite when she was born from the sea.

    According to some tropical astrologers, the current astrological age is the Age of Pisces,while others maintain
     that currently it is the Age of Aquarius.</p>
