<h1> Libra</h1>
<p>In astrology, Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about September 22 to about October 23. It is represented by a woman (sometimes identified with Astraea, the Roman goddess of justice), holding a balance scale or by the balance alone.
Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who 
builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their
 approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.
</p>
<p>Librans are extroverted, cosy, and friendly people. Librans, like the Scales that symbolise the sign, are often concerned with attaining balance, harmony, peace, and justice in the world. With their vast stores of charm, intelligence, frankness, persuasion, and seamless connectivity, they are well-equipped to do so.</p>
