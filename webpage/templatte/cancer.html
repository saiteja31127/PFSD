<h1> Cancer</h1>
<p>In astrology, Cancer is the fourth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about June 22 to about July 22. Its representation as a crab (or lobster or crayfish) is related to the crab in Greek mythology that pinched Heracles while he was fighting the Lernaean hydra.
Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who 
builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their
 approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.</p>
 <p>Cancers have a reputation for being hyper emotional, temperamental, and spiteful. Cancers, in additional to
     being devoted, are extremely fond of their loved ones, often to an unhealthy degree. They place a high value on
      family and close friends, and will go to great lengths to defend them, no matter the price.</p>
