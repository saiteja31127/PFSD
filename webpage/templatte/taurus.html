<h1>  Taurus</h1>
<p>As a sign, Taurus is fixed, an astrological quality that reflects Taurus's steadfast, loyal nature. Fixed signs
     are excellent at maintaining systems and Taureans prioritize consistency and reliability in all areas of their 
     lives.Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who 
builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their
 approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.</p>
 <p>Taurus (♉︎) is the second astrological sign in the modern zodiac. It spans from 30° to 60° of the zodiac. 
    This sign belongs to the Earth element or triplicity, and has a feminine or negative polarity, as well as a 
    fixed modality, quality, or quadruplicity. It is a Venus-ruled sign along with Libra. The Moon is in its
     exaltation here at exactly 3°. The Sun transits this sign from approximately April 20 until May 20 </p>
