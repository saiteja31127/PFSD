<h1>Scorpio</h1> 
<p>As a fixed water sign, Scorpios are known for their loyalty and devotion — and also their passion. In fact, they are known to have such intense personalities that they are often confused with vibrant fire signs. Alas, they just have deep feelings and emotions.
Like their fellow fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who 
builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their
 approach, they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances.</p>
 <p>Scorpio (♏︎) is the eighth astrological sign in the zodiac, originating from the constellation of Scorpius. 
    It spans 210°–240° ecliptic longitude. Under the tropical zodiac (most commonly used in Western astrology),
     the Sun transits this sign on average from October 23 to November 21. Depending on which zodiac system one uses, someone born under the influence of Scorpio may be called a Scorpio or a Scorpionic.</p>
